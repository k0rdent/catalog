  Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access
  control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.
  Harbor, a CNCF Graduated project, delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to
  help you consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms like
  Kubernetes and Docker.
