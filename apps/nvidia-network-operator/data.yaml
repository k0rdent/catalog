description: |
    The NVIDIA Network Operator manages networking-related components to enable high-performance 
    networking, RDMA, and GPUDirect for workloads running in a Kubernetes cluster. It automates 
    the deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management of NVIDIA Mellanox drivers, 
    device plugins, and supporting services required for advanced networking capabilities.

    The Network Operator works in conjunction with the NVIDIA GPU Operator to enable 
    GPUDirect RDMA on compatible systems, ensuring optimal data movement between GPUs 
    and network interfaces while reducing CPU overhead and improving application performance.
