  W&B Weave is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications.
  Designed for flexibility and scalability, Weave supports every stage of your LLM application development workflow:

  - Tracing & Monitoring: Track LLM calls and application logic to debug and analyze production systems.
  - Systematic Iteration: Refine and iterate on prompts, datasets and models.
  - Experimentation: Experiment with different models and prompts in the LLM Playground.
  - Evaluation: Use custom or pre-built scorers alongside our comparison tools to systematically assess and enhance application performance.
  - Guardrails: Protect your application with safeguards for content moderation, prompt safety, and more.
