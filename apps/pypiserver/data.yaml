  #### Overview

  This template provides a standardized "Golden Path" for platform engineers to deploy a minimal
  **pypiserver** instance. It is designed to serve as a central repository for proprietary
  Python artifacts within a k0rdent-managed Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

  In modern cloud-native environments, managing internal Python libraries securely is a core
  requirement. This integration allows teams to host and distribute private packages across
  multi-cloud and edge clusters without relying on public registries.

  #### SW Description

  **pypiserver** is a minimal [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) compatible server for **pip** or **easy_install**.
  It is based on [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) and serves packages from regular directories.
  Wheels, bdists, eggs and accompanying PGP-signatures can be uploaded
  either with **pip**, **setuptools**, **twine**, **pypi-uploader**, or simply copied
  with **scp**.

  **pypiserver** implements the same interfaces as [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), allowing
  standard Python packaging tooling such as **pip** and **twine** to
  interact with it as a package index just as they would with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), while
  making it much easier to get a running index server.
