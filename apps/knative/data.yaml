    k0rdent facilitates the deployment and lifecycle management of Knative within Kubernetes clusters by leveraging its multi-cluster orchestration capabilities. 
    While not a direct integration at the application level, k0rdent simplifies the installation and management of the Knative Operator, 
    ensuring that Knative's serverless and event-driven capabilities are seamlessly deployed and maintained across multiple environments.

    Through k0rdent, users can easily install and manage the Knative Operator, which serves as the foundation for enabling Knative Serving and Eventing. 
    However, Knative itself requires additional configurations to be fully operational. Users must ensure that a supported networking layer—such as Istio, 
    Kourier, or Contour—is deployed before enabling Knative Serving.

    For users opting for Istio as the networking layer, k0rdent provides a dedicated Istio catalog item, which can be deployed separately before installing Knative. 
    This ensures that Knative Serving can leverage Istio's ingress and traffic management capabilities without requiring manual setup.

    Additionally, Knative Eventing may require extra configurations based on the chosen event sources and brokers. 
    This indirect integration streamlines the process of running serverless workloads on Kubernetes, providing a centralized control plane to manage Knative installations, 
    monitor health, and enforce policies across multiple clusters.

    By deploying the Knative Operator alongside Istio from the catalog, k0rdent enables users to build and scale event-driven applications while leveraging Kubernetes-native infrastructure.
