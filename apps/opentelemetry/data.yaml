    OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is a vendor-neutral open source Observability
    framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data
    such as traces, metrics, and logs.

    As an industry-standard, OpenTelemetry is supported by more than 90 observability
    vendors, integrated by many libraries, services, and apps, and adopted by numerous
    end users.
