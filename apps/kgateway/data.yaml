  kgateway is the most mature and widely deployed Envoy-based gateway in the market today.
  Built on open source and open standards, kgateway implements the Kubernetes Gateway API
  with a control plane that scales from lightweight microgateway deployments between
  services, to massively parallel centralized gateways handling billions of API calls, to
  advanced AI gateway use cases for safety, security, and governance when serving models or
  integrating applications with third-party LLMs. kgateway brings omni-directional API
  connectivity to any cloud and any environment.

  kgateway was launched in 2018 as Gloo. Since then, the project has steadily evolved to
  become the most trusted and feature-rich API gateway for Kubernetes, processing billions
  of API requests for many of the world's biggest companies.
