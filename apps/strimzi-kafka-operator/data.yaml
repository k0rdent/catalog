  ## Introduction
  This chart bootstraps the Strimzi Cluster Operator Deployment, Cluster Roles, Cluster Role
  Bindings, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions for
  running on cluster using the Helm package manager.

  ## Supported Features
   - **Manages the Kafka Cluster** - Deploys and manages all of the components of this complex application, including dependencies like Apache ZooKeeper® that are traditionally hard to administer.
   - **KRaft support** - Allows running Apache Kafka clusters in the KRaft mode (without ZooKeeper).
   - **Includes Kafka Connect** - Allows for configuration of common data sources and sinks to move data into and out of the Kafka cluster.
   - **Topic Management** - Creates and manages Kafka Topics within the cluster.
   - **User Management** - Creates and manages Kafka Users within the cluster.
   - **Connector Management** - Creates and manages Kafka Connect connectors.
   - **Includes Kafka MirrorMaker** - Allows for mirroring data between different Apache Kafka® clusters.
   - **Includes HTTP Kafka Bridge** - Allows clients to send and receive messages through an Apache Kafka® cluster via the HTTP protocol.
   - **Includes Cruise Control** - Automates the process of balancing partitions across an Apache Kafka® cluster.
   - **Auto-rebalancing when scaling** - Automatically rebalance the Kafka cluster after a scale-up or before a scale-down.
   - **Tiered storage** - Offloads older, less critical data to a lower-cost, lower-performance storage tier, such as object storage.
   - **Prometheus monitoring** - Built-in support for monitoring using Prometheus.
   - **Grafana Dashboards** - Built-in support for loading Grafana® dashboards via the grafana_sidecar
