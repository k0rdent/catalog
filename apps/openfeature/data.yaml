    ### Introduction

    The **Open Feature Operator** is a Kubernetes-native operator that enables
    applications to consume feature flags in a standardized way using the OpenFeature
    specification. The operator injects a sidecar container into application pods, allowing
    them to communicate with a `flagd` service and evaluate feature flags at runtime.

    By running as a Kubernetes operator, Open Feature Operator simplifies the lifecycle
    management of feature flag configuration and sidecar injection, making feature flag
    usage consistent and portable across clusters and environments.

    For full project documentation, refer to the upstream OpenFeature Operator
    documentation.

    ### Prerequisites

    - A Kubernetes cluster managed by k0rdent.
    - **cert-manager** installed on the target cluster.
    - The **OpenFeature Operator** installed on the target cluster
    before deploying workloads that rely on feature flags.
    - Applications must be compatible with the OpenFeature SDK and
    sidecar-based flag evaluation model.
