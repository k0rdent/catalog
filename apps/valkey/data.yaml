    Valkey is a high-performance in-memory data store that supports various data structures
    including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It's a drop-in replacement for
    Redis with enhanced features and performance optimizations. Valkey can be used as a
    database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine.
