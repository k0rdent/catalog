Release {{ .Release.Name }} successfully installed.

A MultiClusterService named {{ include "propagate-secrets.fullname" . }}-mcs has been installed. 
It references the provided secrets in .Values.propagate.secrets in its .spec.servicesSpec.services.templateResourceRefs field.

Usage Example:

Let's say we have a secret named `secret-dockercfg` in the k0rdent management cluster.
We need to propagate it to "myns" namespace on a target cluster with the following labels:
  k0rdent.mirantis.com/component=kcm
  helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name=wali-dev-1
  helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/namespace=kcm-system


To do we can install the propagate-secrets chart with:
  $ helm install myrelease oci://ghcr.io/k0rdent/catalog/charts/propagate-secrets --version 1.0.0 -f values.yaml

Where the `values.yaml` file has the following contents:
  propagate:
    secrets:
      - name: secret-dockercfg
        namespace: kcm-system
        targetNamespace: myns
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      k0rdent.mirantis.com/component: kcm
      helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name: wali-dev-1
      helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/namespace: kcm-system

The secret `myns/secret-dockercfg` should appear on the target cluster eventually after the MultiClusterService created by the release has been successfully reconciled.
