    SGLang is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.
    It makes your interaction with models faster and more controllable by co-designing the backend runtime and frontend language.
    The core features include:
    
    - **Fast Backend Runtime**: Provides efficient serving with RadixAttention for prefix caching, zero-overhead CPU scheduler, continuous batching, token attention (paged attention), speculative decoding, tensor parallelism, chunked prefill, structured outputs, quantization (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ), and multi-lora batching.
    - **Flexible Frontend Language**: Offers an intuitive interface for programming LLM applications, including chained generation calls, advanced prompting, control flow, multi-modal inputs, parallelism, and external interactions.
    - **Extensive Model Support**: Supports a wide range of generative models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, QWen, DeepSeek, LLaVA, etc.), embedding models (e5-mistral, gte, mcdse) and reward models (Skywork), with easy extensibility for integrating new models.
    - **Active Community**: SGLang is open-source and backed by an active community with industry adoption.
