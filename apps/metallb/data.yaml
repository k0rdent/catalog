description: |
  MetalLB hooks into your Kubernetes cluster, and provides a network load-balancer implementation.
  In short, it allows you to create Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer in clusters that donâ€™t
  run on a cloud provider, and thus cannot simply hook into paid products to provide load balancers.
