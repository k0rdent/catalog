  k0rdent facilitates the deployment and management of MySQL within Kubernetes clusters by
  leveraging its multi-cluster management capabilities. While not a direct integration at
  the application level, k0rdent simplifies the orchestration of the Kubernetes environment
  where MySQL operates. Through k0rdent, users can easily deploy MySQL service templates,
  manage persistent storage, scale deployments, monitor pod health, and enforce security
  policies across multiple clusters. This indirect integration streamlines the process of
  running and maintaining MySQL databases in containerized environments, providing a
  centralized control plane for managing the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.
