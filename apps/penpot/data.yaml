  Penpot is the first **open-source** design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive
  prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast.
  And all of this with no handoff drama.

  Penpot is available on browser and [self host](https://penpot.app/self-host). It's web-based and works with open standards
  (SVG, CSS and HTML). And last but not least, it's free!
