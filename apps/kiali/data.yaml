  Kiali is an observability console for Istio with service mesh configuration and validation capabilities.

  It helps you understand the structure and health of your service mesh by monitoring traffic flow to
  infer the topology and report errors. Kiali provides detailed metrics and a basic Grafana integration,
  which can be used for advanced queries. Distributed tracing is provided by integration with Jaeger.
