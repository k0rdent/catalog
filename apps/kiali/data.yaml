  Kiali is a service mesh observability console that provides topology visualization,
  deep traffic metrics, and health checks for microservices deployed within an Istio service mesh environment.

  It works by:

  - Collecting data from Prometheus (for metrics) and Istio (for configuration and traffic).
  - Displaying the service graph, showing how traffic flows between applications .

  Kiali integrates with k0rdent by serving as a core observability component within
  k0rdent's multi-cluster platform. When k0rdent provisions a child cluster with an
  Istio service mesh enabled (potentially leveraging k0rdent's Service Templates).

  It allows Platform Engineers to visually monitor the operational health, traffic routing
  (e.g., canary rollouts), and security policies of applications running across the
  k0rdent-managed fleet from a single point of control.
