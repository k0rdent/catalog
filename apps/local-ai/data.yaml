  **LocalAI** is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI
  (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not
  only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU. It is created and
  maintained by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler).
