  Jenkins is commonly deployed as a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) tool. Use it to:

  - Automate project builds  
  - Run automated tests to catch regressions early  
  - Perform static code analysis  
  - Automate deployment to staging or production environments  

  By executing repetitive development tasks, Jenkins helps teams reduce manual work, save time, and increase productivity across the SDLC.

  #### Distribution & Installation

  Jenkins offers multiple distribution formats:

  - Docker images  
  - Native packages (e.g., Debian, RPM)  
  - WAR files  
  - Windows installers  

  For details, visit the [Downloads page](https://www.jenkins.io/download).

  There are two release channels:

  - [**Weekly**](https://www.jenkins.io/download/weekly/): Includes the latest features and fixes.  
  - [**LTS (Long-Term Support)**](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/): Updated periodically with critical fixes for stability.
