  VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable monitoring solution and time series database.
  
  It is designed to collect, store, and process real-time metrics, making it an excellent choice for monitoring applications, infrastructure, and business metrics. VictoriaMetrics can be used as a long-term remote storage for Prometheus or as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus with better performance and lower resource usage.
  
  Key features:
  - High performance and resource efficiency
  - Excellent compression for time series data
  - Easy to operate and maintain
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Global query view
  - Long-term storage
  - Prometheus compatibility

  **Storage Configuration:**
  
  The example deployment uses emptyDir storage for universal compatibility. Data will be lost on pod restart.
  
  For production use, configure persistent storage:
  
  ~~~yaml
  victoriametrics:
    victoria-metrics-single:
      server:
        persistentVolume:
          enabled: true
          size: 100Gi
          storageClass: "your-storage-class"
  ~~~
  
  For additional configuration options including authentication, retention settings, and performance tuning, refer to the [official VictoriaMetrics Helm chart documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoriametrics-single/).
prerequisites: |
  **Storage Requirements:**
  
  - **Testing/Evaluation**: Uses emptyDir storage (data lost on restart) - works on any cluster
  - **Production**: Requires persistent volumes with a configured StorageClass
  
  **Network Access:**
  
  - LoadBalancer service type is used for external access
  - Port 8428 for VictoriaMetrics HTTP API and web interface
