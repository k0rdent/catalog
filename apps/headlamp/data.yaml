  Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

  Headlamp was created to blend the traditional feature set of other web UIs/dashboards
  (i.e., to list and view resources) with added functionality.

  Headlamp can be used in-cluster, where it's accessed through a web browser, or as a desktop
  application (using the information defined in the user's kubeconfig).
