    KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added into any Kubernetes cluster. KEDA works alongside
    standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or
    duplication. With KEDA, you can explicitly map the apps you want to use event-driven scale, with other apps continuing to
    function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside any number of any other Kubernetes applications or
    frameworks.
