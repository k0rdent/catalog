  The **Dell Container Storage Modules Helm Chart** provides a unified way to deploy Dell's portfolio of Kubernetes storage and data services.  
  It bundles multiple Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers and complementary modules into a single installation,  
  allowing operators to select and enable only the components relevant to their infrastructure.  

  This chart is designed for environments where multiple Dell storage backends and data services may be in use,  
  simplifying lifecycle management by consolidating dependencies under one umbrella.

  ## Included Modules

  ### CSI Drivers (choose per storage backend)
  - **csi-powerstore** - CSI driver for Dell PowerStore arrays.
  - **csi-powermax** - CSI driver for Dell PowerMax storage.
  - **csi-isilon** - CSI driver for Dell PowerScale (Isilon) systems.
  - **csi-vxflexos** - CSI driver for PowerFlex (formely VxFlexOS, ScaleIO) systems.
  - **csi-unity** - CSI driver for Dell Unity XT storage.

  ### Data Services
  - **csm-replication** - Enables Dell Container Storage Modules (CSM) replication features for disaster recovery and business continuity across clusters and storage systems.
  - **karavi-observability** - Provides observability and monitoring for Dell CSI drivers, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana for storage-level insights.

  ### Supporting Infrastructure
  - **cert-manager** - Automates the management of TLS certificates required by certain components.
  > Note: install of cert-manager is optional and required once per cluster.

  ## Key Features
  - Centralized deployment of multiple Dell storage backends.
  - Fine-grained enablement via `values.yaml` conditions.
  - Support for advanced storage features like replication and observability.
  - Simplified integration with Kubernetes multi-cluster environments.

  ## Use Cases
  - Enterprises operating mixed Dell storage platforms (PowerStore, PowerMax, PowerScale, Unity, PowerFlex).
  - Multi-cluster workloads requiring **replication** for disaster recovery.
  - Kubernetes operators needing **end-to-end observability** into Dell storage operations.

  ## Support
  - Please refer to the [Dell CSM official documentation](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/support/) for the helm install instructions.
  - The details of all possible values is available on the [helm-charts repository](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/blob/main/installation-wizard/container-storage-modules/values.yaml).
