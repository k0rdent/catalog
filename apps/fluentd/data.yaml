  Fluentd is a highly flexible, open-source data collector designed to unify logging across distributed
  systems. It allows you to collect, parse, transform, and forward logs and events from multiple
  sources to a wide range of storage and analytics backends.

  Fluentd supports hundreds of input and output plugins, enabling integration with popular platforms
  such as Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Loki, Kafka, S3, and many others. It is widely used in Kubernetes
  environments to aggregate container logs and forward them to centralized logging systems.

  #### Key Features

  - Unified log collection from containers, nodes, and applications
  - Rich plugin ecosystem (1000+ plugins)
  - Structured log processing and transformation
  - Reliable buffering and retry mechanisms
  - Kubernetes-native deployment support
  - Multi-output routing and filtering

  #### Why deploy Fluentd with k0rdent?

  Using the k0rdent Service Template (kgst), Fluentd can be deployed consistently across multiple Kubernetes clusters as a MultiClusterService. This enables:

  - Centralized logging strategy across clusters
  - Standardized configuration management
  - Scalable log aggregation in multi-cluster environments
  - Simplified lifecycle management (install, upgrade, remove)

  Fluentd is an essential building block for implementing observability and log aggregation in production-grade Kubernetes platforms.
