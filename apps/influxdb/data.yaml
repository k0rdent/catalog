  InfluxDB Core is a database built to collect, process, transform, and store event and time series data. It is ideal for use cases that require real-time ingest and fast query response times to build user interfaces, monitoring, and automation solutions.

  Common use cases include:

  - Monitoring sensor data
  - Server monitoring
  - Application performance monitoring
  - Network monitoring
  - Financial market and trading analytics
  - Behavioral analytics

  InfluxDB is optimized for scenarios where near real-time data monitoring is essential and queries 
  need to return quickly to support user experiences such as dashboards and interactive user interfaces.
