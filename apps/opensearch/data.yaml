  OpenSearch is a community-driven, open-source search and analytics suite derived from
  Elasticsearch and Kibana.

  It consists of:

   - OpenSearch: A distributed, highly scalable search engine that is used for full-text
     search, log analytics, security monitoring, and application monitoring.
   - OpenSearch Dashboards: A visualization tool that lets users analyze and visualize data
     stored in OpenSearch through interactive dashboards.

  OpenSearch provides essential features like security, fine-grained access control,
  anomaly detection, and alerting, making it a popular choice for enterprise-grade data
  ingestion and analysis, often serving as the data backbone for observability and
  security platforms.
