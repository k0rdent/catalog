  **LeaderWorkerSet (LWS)** is an API for deploying a group of pods as a unit of replication.
  It aims to address common deployment patterns of AI/ML inference workloads, especially multi-host inference workloads
  where the LLM will be sharded and run across multiple devices on multiple nodes.  
  
  An LWS creates a group of pods based on two different templates (the leader template and the worker template),
  and controls their lifecycle.  
  
  **Feature Overview:**  
  
  - **Group of Pods as a unit:** Supports a tightly managed group of pods that represent a “super pod”
      - **Unique pod identity:** Each pod in the group has a unique index from 0 to n-1.
      - **Parallel creation:** Pods in the group will have the same lifecycle and be created in parallel.
  - **Dual-template, one for leader and one for the workers:** A replica is a group of a single leader and a set of workers, and allow to specify a template for the workers and optionally use a second one for the leader pod.
  - **Multiple groups with identical specifications:** Supports creating multiple “replicas” of the above mentioned group. Each group is a single unit for rolling update, scaling, and maps to a single exclusive topology for placement.
  - **A scale subresource:** A scale endpoint is exposed for HPA to dynamically scale the number replicas (aka number of groups)
  - **Rollout and Rolling update:** Supports performing rollout and rolling update at the group level, which means the groups are upgraded one by one as a unit (i.e. the pods within a group are updated together).
  - **Topology-aware placement:** Opt-in support for pods in the same group to be co-located in the same topology.
  - **All-or-nothing restart for failure handling:** Opt-in support for all pods in the group to be recreated if one pod in the group failed or one container in the pods is restarted.
