description: |
    Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform that provides
    centralized authentication, authorization, and single sign-on (SSO) for modern applications.
    It offloads identity and security concerns from application developers by handling user
    authentication and access control in a consistent, reusable way.
  
    Keycloak supports standard identity protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML,
    and offers features including user federation (LDAP/Active Directory integration), social
    login, multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA), and a web-based administrative console for
    managing users, roles, and authorization policies. Through SSO and identity brokering,
    users can authenticate once and access multiple applications using a variety of identity
    providers.
  
    > **Note**
    >
    > This deployment uses the modern KeycloakX (Quarkus-based) Keycloak distribution, installed
    > and managed via the community-maintained [Codecentric Helm chart](https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts),
    > which tracks upstream Keycloak container images and follows recommended configuration practices.
