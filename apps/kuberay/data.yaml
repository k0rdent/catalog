  KubeRay is an open-source Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing [Ray](https://www.ray.io) applications.
  It provides Kubernetes-native custom resources to support distributed workloads efficiently and reliably.
  
  #### Key Resources
  
  - **RayCluster**  
    Manages the full lifecycle of a Ray cluster, including autoscaling, fault tolerance, and cluster upgrades.
  
  - **RayJob**  
    Creates a temporary RayCluster, submits a job, and optionally deletes the cluster after completion. Useful for batch
    and scheduled workloads.
  
  - **RayService**  
    Combines a RayCluster with a Ray Serve deployment graph. Enables zero-downtime upgrades and high availability for
    serving APIs or models.
  
  #### k0rdent Integration

  KubeRay is compatible with k0rdent's multi-cluster model. You can deploy it using the MultiClusterService
  and manage Ray workloads declaratively across clusters.
