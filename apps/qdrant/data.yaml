  **Qdrant** (read: _quadrant_) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database.
  
  It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage pointsâ€”vectors with an additional payload
  Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

  Qdrant is written in Rust ðŸ¦€, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See [benchmarks](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/).

  With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!

  Qdrant is also available as a fully managed **[Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)** â›… including a **free tier**.
