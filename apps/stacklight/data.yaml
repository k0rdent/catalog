  Mirantis StackLight LMA is a comprehensive Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting software
  suite designed to provide a unified operational view, or "single pane of glass,"
  for managing cloud environments. By leveraging integrated open-source tools such as
  Prometheus for time-series metrics and monitoring, and OpenSearch for log aggregation
  and analysis, StackLight delivers critical insights into the health and performance
  of the cloud infrastructure and its services, supporting effective day-to-day
  operations and maintenance activities.
  
  This centralized approach significantly speeds up troubleshooting and enables proactive
  identification of potential issues before they impact end-users. Consequently, it enhances
  overall system reliability and simplifies the complexities of cloud management.
  
  In Mirantis k0rdent Enterprise, StackLight is distributed as Kubernetes Operator--a
  CustomResourceDefinition (stacklights.monitoring.mirantis.com) and corresponding
  controller--and is installed as a Helm chart. For Mirantis k0rdent
  Virtualzation (KubeVirt) as part of Mirantis k0rdent Enterprise, StackLight is
  distributed as a ServiceTemplate object.
  
  StackLight consists of the following components:

  - Prometheus: Provides a time-series database
  - Prometheus Relay: Prometheus API High Availability proxy
  - Grafana: For timeseries visualization
  - AlertManager: Notifications system
  - Alerta: Provides alerts visualization
  - cAdvisor: Exports metrics
  - Node Exporter: OS metrics collector
  - Blackbox exporter: Provides endpoint probes
  - Kube-state-metrics: K8s objects metrics collector
  - OpenSearch: A database for system and audit logs
  - OpenSearch Dashboards: Provides logs visualization
  - Fluentd: A tool for logs collecting and processing
  - Spilo: A High Availability Postgresql solution using Patroni (as a backend for Alerta and Grafana)
