    The Zalando Postgres Operator delivers an easy to run highly-available PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes powered by Patroni. 
    It is configured only through PostgreSQL manifests (CRDs) to ease integration into automated CI/CD pipelines with 
    no access to Kubernetes API directly, promoting infrastructure as code vs manual operations.

    k0rdent facilitates the deployment and lifecycle management of the Zalando Postgres Operator within Kubernetes clusters by leveraging 
    its multi-cluster orchestration capabilities. Through k0rdent, users can easily deploy and manage the operator, which serves as the 
    foundation for highly available PostgreSQL clusters within the Kubernetes environment.

    * Rolling updates on Postgres cluster changes, including quick minor version updates
    * Live volume resize without pod restarts
    * Database connection pooling with PGBouncer
    * Fast in-place major version upgrades and support for global upgrade of all clusters
    * Restore and cloning Postgres clusters on AWS, GCS, and Azure
    * Logical backups to S3 or GCS bucket
    * Standby cluster from S3 or GCS WAL archive
    * Configurable for non-cloud environments
    * Basic credential and user management on Kubernetes
    * Support for custom TLS certificates
    * UI to create and edit Postgres cluster manifests

    ## PostgreSQL Features
