  ### Why RabbitMQ?
  RabbitMQ is a reliable and mature messaging and streaming broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments,
  on-premises, and on your local machine. It is currently used by millions worldwide.

  #### Interoperable
  RabbitMQ supports several open standard protocols, including AMQP 1.0 and MQTT 5.0. There are multiple client libraries available,
  which can be used with your programming language of choice, just pick one. No vendor lock-in!

  #### Flexible
  RabbitMQ provides many options you can combine to define how your messages go from the publisher to one or many consumers.
  Routing, filtering, streaming, federation, and so on, you name it.

  #### Reliable
  With the ability to acknowledge message delivery and to replicate messages across a cluster, you can
  ensure your messages are safe with RabbitMQ.
