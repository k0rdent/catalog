    Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful
    features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio is the path to load balancing,
    service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes.
