  ## Overview

  **MLflow** is an open-source platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle
  — from experimentation and reproducibility to deployment and monitoring. It provides a unified
  interface and standardized tooling for teams building and maintaining ML models, making it easier
  to collaborate and track model performance over time.

  MLflow's architecture emphasizes flexibility: it integrates seamlessly with various machine
  learning libraries and frameworks (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn) and supports
  deployment to multiple environments including local servers, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.

  ## Key Features

  - **Experiment Tracking:** Record, compare, and visualize runs with parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
  - **Model Registry:** Centralized hub to manage model versions, lifecycle stages, and approvals.
  - **Project Packaging:** Standardized format for reproducible machine learning projects using conda or Docker environments.
  - **Model Deployment:** Simplified deployment to multiple platforms — local, Kubernetes, or cloud services.
  - **REST and Python APIs:** Access all MLflow components programmatically.
