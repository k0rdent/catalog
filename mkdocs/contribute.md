# How to contribute an Application

To add application to k0rdent open-source applications catalog create a PR to [catalog repository](https://github.com/k0rdent/catalog).

The PR should contain following updates:

## Add catalog application page
Add `mkdocs/app/<my-app>/data.yaml` file.

## Add working example
Add example folder for the application to catalog [examples folder](../examples/).
The example needs to work with a [common testing workflow](../examples/README.md#run-example) so anyone is able to verify it works easily.
