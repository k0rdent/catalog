# How to Contribute an Application

To add an application to the k0rdent open-source applications catalog, create a pull request (PR) in the **[catalog repository](https://github.com/k0rdent/catalog)**.

The PR should include the following updates:

## Add a catalog application page
Add a `mkdocs/app/<my-app>/data.yaml` file.

## Add a working example
Create an example folder for the application in the catalog **[examples folder](https://github.com/k0rdent/catalog/tree/main/examples)**.

Ensure the example works with a **[common testing workflow](https://github.com/k0rdent/catalog/tree/main/examples#run-example)** so that anyone can easily verify its functionality.
