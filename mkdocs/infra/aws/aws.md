=== "Description"

    k0rdent, as a multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, integrates with AWS to provide a seamless experience for managing and deploying Kubernetes clusters and applications on the AWS cloud. Here's how this integration works:

    - Cluster Deployment: k0rdent can deploy Kubernetes clusters on AWS using CAPI. 
    - Infrastructure Management: k0rdent can provision and manage AWS infrastructure resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups, required for your Kubernetes clusters.
    - Centralized Management: Manage your AWS-based Kubernetes clusters from the k0rdent control plane, along with clusters on other platforms.
    - Cost Optimization: k0rdent can provide insights into your AWS spending and help you optimize resource allocation for your Kubernetes deployments.
    - Security and Compliance: k0rdent integrates with AWS security services to ensure your Kubernetes clusters and applications are secure and compliant with industry standards.
